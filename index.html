    <p>A few minutes into the call, Steve Doocy discusses James Comey and the memos:</p>
    <p class="quotation">Well, he says he&rsquo;s not a leaker. He disputed what Anderson Cooper had said. But what&rsquo;s interesting is we&rsquo;ve learned through Catherine Herridge's reporting is that apparently the guy he gave the secret memos to, Dr. Richman at Columbia University — he had this special government employee status where he had — you know, he could look at secrets. He had a badge to the building. And also, apparently, the memos were leaked to a wider group of people or at least two, maybe three, including former U.S. attorney Patrick Fitzgerald. Your opinion on what Mr. Comey is doing on his book tour and the fact that he had a special friend at Columbia University with an FBI badge.</p>
    <p>President Trump begins answering the question, discussing Comey for 33 seconds, when he starts jumping around.</p>
